# 🌡️ Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter — Compare Normal, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot Versions

This repository contains three versions of a **Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter**. These versions were developed using different approaches and tools:
1. **Normal Version (My version)**: The simplest, my original version of this code.
2. **ChatGPT Version**: Enhanced with modern, futuristic UI elements, animations, and smooth interactivity.
3. **GitHub Copilot Version**: futuristic, animated, and responsive design featuring gradient effects, glassmorphism, and interactive elements.
   
This repository allows you to compare how each approach addresses the same problem in terms of functionality, design, and code structure.
